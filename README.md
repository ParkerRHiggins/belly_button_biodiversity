# belly_button_biodiversity

For this project, I used Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web.

### Horizontal Bar Chart

First, using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

### Bubble Chart

Next, using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I created a bubble chart that displays the otu_ids as the x-axis values, the sample_values as the y-axis values, the sample_values as the marker size, the otu_ids as the marker colors and the otu_labels as the hover-text values when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.

### Gauge Chart

Next, using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

### Customized Dashboard and Deploy

Lastly, I used HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard and deployed an interactive chart to GitHub Pages for others to reference.  The completed dashboard can be referenced in GitHub Pages under the Environments section of my belly_button_biodiversity repository.
